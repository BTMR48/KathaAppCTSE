Early detection & treatment of phonological errors of children

We have developed an app for children aged 2-4 years with the objective of early detection and treatment of Sinhala phonological disorders in children. The app allows children to record their voice, which speech pathologists can listen to in order to detect any phonological errors. Speech pathologists can also record the correct pronunciation of words, and children can listen to those recordings to learn the correct pronunciation. Additionally, speech pathologists can add notes after listening to the recordings of children, for example, "The child has improved" or "Identified initial consonant disorder." If a speech pathologist identifies a disorder, they can recommend therapy activities for the child. There are different therapy activities in this app that children can do to improve themselves. The app also allows speech pathologists to manage users of the app, including registering new children/users, updating existing ones, and deleting users.

1.	Allowing children to record their voice for speech pathologists to listen to and detect any phonological errors.
